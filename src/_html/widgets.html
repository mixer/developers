    <h1>Anatomy of a Widget</h1>
    <p>
      A widget is, most basically, simply a folder in our repository (linked
      above) that contains a <code>widget.js</code> file. The directory
      structure tends to look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
myWidget
|-- widget.js
|-- chat
|   |-- index.js
|   +-- more_supporting_files
+-- test
    |-- one.test.js
    +-- another.test.js</pre>
    <p>The <code>widget.js</code> might look something like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">module.exports = {
  // Package name
  name: 'Polls',
  // Whether it's enabled by default
  default: true,
  // Beam username(s) of the author(s).
  authors: ['connor4312'],
  // Hooks for Beam chat servers/frontend.
  hooks: {
      chat: require('./chat')
  },
  // Description to display to users.
  description: 'Allow people to create polls and let viewers vote on them!',
  // Additional permissions roles should get to use the widget.
  permissions: {
      User:  ['chat:poll_vote'],
      Mod:   ['chat:poll_vote', 'chat:poll_start'],
      Admin: ['chat:poll_vote', 'chat:poll_start'],
      Owner: ['chat:poll_vote', 'chat:poll_start']
  }
};</code></pre>
    <p>
      It's mostly pretty straightforward. The two parts that do warrant
      additional explaination are the permissions and hooks. Hooks is a map
      of strings to functions to register your widget various "environments"
      (currently, chat is the only available hook, but this will expand).
      Hooking differents between environments; refer to the sections below
      for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permissions is simply an array of permission strings that your widget
      needs to operate. In the example, you can see that we let Users, Mods,
      Admins, and Owners have a permission to vote in polls, but only Mods,
      Admins, and Owners have permission to start polls. You can verify and
      restrict access based on permissions in individual hooks.

    <h2>Chat</h2>
    <p>
      We allow you to hook into the chat server backend, adding
      middleware-like functions to modify or abort ongoing actions.
      Backend widgets are written in Node.js, and will be reviewed fairly
      rigorously as they'll be running in a production environment!
      In general:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unit test your modules the best you're able to. We've got a nice
        stack of Mocha mixed with Chai and Sinon, along with useful
        fixtures, whipped up for you. Check out the "test" folders of
        existing widgets for reference.
      </li>
      <li>Errors should be logged and handled gracefully.</li>
      <li>Avoid, whenever possible, additional network calls or database hits.</li>
      <li>Use jsdoc's format to document your code.</li>
      <li>
        Run npm test locally before opening a pull request. This will run
        all tests and verify your code against our linters and code style
        guide.
      </li>
      <li>Write beautiful code. We love beautiful code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following modules are installed on the chat server available for
      you to consume anywhere in your widget. We'd prefer to avoid adding
      additional modules for widgets; if you think that you absolutely need
      something, let us know and we'll find a solution.

    <h2>Building Chat Hooks</h2>
    <p>
      On the chat server we can hook into both events and methods, which
      provide two distinct types of functionality. When a user wants to do
      one specific task, they trigger a method for it, and that's the only
      time a method can be called. Events, on the other hand, can be
      triggered in a variety of circumstances, such as a user joining a
      channel, a chat message being sent, or your own events!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that not every user of a chat will be
      connected to the same chat server instance. For communication across
      chats, we generally publish Redis events using the <code>channel.emit</code>
      method, then listen for them later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let's get started! Be sure to have the JSDoc for the chat server
      (linked at the top of the page) open for reference, and an existing
      widget as well.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">// Example hooks file `polls/chat/index.js`
  module.exports = function (hook) {
    hook.method('permission', 'vote:start', ['poll_start', require('./start').hook]);
    hook.method('permission', 'vote:choose', ['poll_vote', require('./vote')]);
    hook.event('PollStart', require('./events').start);
    hook.event('PollEnd', require('./events').end);
  };</code></pre>

    <h3>Method Hooks</h3>
    <p>
      Method hooks are triggered by a user sending a "message" directly to
      the chat server. The handler methods can be defined as guarded or
      unguarded:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td style="width: 350px"><code>.method(String event, Function handler)</code></td>
        <td><p>
          The simplest invocation. Your handler function won't be guarded.
          Anyone, including guests, can send the method. Handler will be
          called with <code>(WebSocket socket, Array args, Function respond).</code>
        </p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="width: 350px"><code>.method(String guard, String event, Any handler)</code></td>
        <td><p>
          You function will be guarded by the guard you specify. Currently we have:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>user</code> - Your handler should be a function. It
              won't be run unless the requesting user is authenticated.
              Its arguments will be
              <code>(User user, Array args, Function respond)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>permissions</code> - Your handler should be an array.
              The first element should be the permission name, the second
              should be a function. The function won't be run unless the
              user is authenticated and has the given permission. Arguments
              are the same as the above.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Event Hooks</h3>
    <p>
      Event hooks are a bit simpler. They are currently only triggered by
      events emitted across Redis, and are called with the data they were
      broadcast on and arbitrary data. Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">/**
 * Handles a new creation poll event. It attaches an _ongoing_vote vote
 * to the channel object for use later, and broadcasts to users.
 * @param  {Object} channel
 * @param  {Object} data
 */
module.exports.start = function (channel, data) {
  channel._ongoing_vote = data.endsAt;
  channel.broadcast('PollStart', data);
};</code></pre>

    <p>
      You can trigger these events yourself as well, by using the
      <code>channel.emit</code> method. For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">channel.emit('PollStart', {
  question: question,
  answers: answers,
  duration: duration,
  endsAt: Date.now() + duration * 1000
});</code></pre>
